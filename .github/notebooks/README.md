You can use GitHub issue notebooks to query GitHub items, such as PRs, issues, milestones etc., across multiple repos.

## Get started

- Install the [GitHub issues notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks) extension
- In VSCode, login to your GitHub account by clicking on the Accounts button located at the bottom left side of the panel.
  - [Working with GitHub in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github)
- Open a `.github-issues` file in VSCode and you should be able to run the queries through the `Run All` button at the top

You can use [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) to help you write your own queries
