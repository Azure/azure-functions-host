- Add support for standalone executable (ie: `dotnet build --standalone`) for out-of-proc workers in Linux Consumption. (#9550)
- Bug fix: Do not restart worker channels or JobHost when an API request is made to get or update the function metadata (unless the config was changed) (#9510)
  - This fixes a bug where requests to 'admin/functions' lead to a "Did not find initialized workers" error when
    worker indexing is enabled.
- Bug fix: If there are no channels created and the host is running, restart the JobHost instead of shutting down worker channels (#9510)
  - This fixes a bug with worker indexing where we are shutting down worker channels and creating a new channel that never
    gets properly initialized as the invocation buffers are not created - this leads to a "Did not find initialized workers" error.
