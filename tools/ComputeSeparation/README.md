# Compute separation with Aspire

A local development tool for running the real Functions Host, WorkerProxy, and .NET isolated `SampleIsolatedApp` together.

The tool supplies no `host.json`. It sets the Host's existing read-only app-content option, so the unchanged Host uses defaults without writing that file.

## Prerequisites

- The repository's .NET SDK.
- For container deployment only, a running Linux x64 Docker engine with Docker Compose.

The first build downloads the matching Aspire toolchain into the worktree's build output. A global Aspire installation and Azure Functions Core Tools are not required.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

## Run with F5

Open `Azure.Functions.Host.slnx`, set `ComputeSeparation.AppHost` as the startup project, select a launch profile, and press **F5**:

| Profile | Runs locally |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | The Host, WorkerProxy, sample worker, and a fake platform as .NET projects for managed C# debugging. No Docker required. |
| `project-placeholder-manual` | Same as `project`, but the Host starts in placeholder mode, nothing is assigned or linked automatically, and ports are pinned for `compute-separation.http`. See [Placeholder mode](#placeholder-mode). |
| `project-placeholder-manual-multi-worker` | Same manual placeholder flow, with two independent WorkerProxy/worker pairs sharing one Host. Use `compute-separation-multi-worker.http`. See [Multi-worker testing](#multi-worker-testing). |
| `container` | Three Linux containers: a ReadyToRun Host, Native AOT WorkerProxy, and ReadyToRun sample worker. |

`project` and `container` link the worker automatically. In `project`, AppHost asks the fake platform to assign the pod and then link the worker, in that order. Every profile starts an Aspire dashboard. Container images are built from the current worktree; the first build can take several minutes. Nothing is published or deployed remotely.

The equivalent command-line launches are:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project-placeholder-manual
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project-placeholder-manual-multi-worker
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile container
```

Run one profile at a time; the manual profiles share fixed ports. Stop the current AppHost before switching profiles. No mode requires `aspire deploy` or `aspire publish`.

## Try the sample

Open the dashboard URL printed at startup. Find `functions-host` in project mode or `runtime` in container mode, open its `http` endpoint, and append `/api/hello`.

Once the Host has started, GET or POST requests return:

```text
Hello from the BYOC .NET isolated worker.
```

## Fake platform

In project mode, the `fake-platform` resource is a local stand-in for the platform. It sends the assign and link requests to the WorkerProxy and Host.

Open the `fake-platform` console logs in the dashboard to watch the assign and link calls in order. The fake is not wired in container mode.

## Endpoints

### Expected flow

The happy path, in order:

| Step | Endpoint on | Caller | Request | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | WorkerProxy | Platform | `PUT /admin/worker/assignment` | Assigns the pod once its worker has connected. |
| 2 | Host | Platform | `POST /admin/instance/assign` | Assigns the placeholder Host to the app, which then specializes. Not sent in `project`, whose Host starts already specialized. |
| 3 | Host | Platform | `PUT /admin/workers/{workerId}` | Links the worker through the WorkerProxy runtime gRPC endpoint. |
| 4 | Host | Client | `GET /api/hello` | Invokes the function through Host -> WorkerProxy -> worker. |

`GET /admin/worker/state` on the WorkerProxy reports the pod state at any time. The `project` profile sends steps 1 and 3 through the fake platform automatically; `project-placeholder-manual` leaves steps 1 to 3 to you.

### Test-only

Simulation routes live under `/simulate`, so they are never confused with the real contracts above.

| Endpoint on | Request | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/worker/assign` | Sends step 1 to the WorkerProxy and returns its response. |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/host/assign` | Sends step 2 to the Host and returns its response; see [Placeholder mode](#placeholder-mode). |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/worker/link` | Sends step 3 to the Host and returns its response. |

## Send requests manually

`compute-separation.http` walks through the expected flow one step at a time by calling the fake platform, which sends the assign and link calls. Run the `project-placeholder-manual` profile, then open the file in Visual Studio or VS Code with the REST Client extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In `project-placeholder-manual`, nothing is assigned or linked until you send the requests. Wait until every resource is **Running** in the dashboard, then send the numbered requests (1 to 4) in the order they appear in the file. If assign returns `503`, the sample worker has not connected yet; retry it before moving on. The requests marked *Optional* can be sent at any time.

### Multi-worker testing

Select `project-placeholder-manual-multi-worker` and open [compute-separation-multi-worker.http](compute-separation-multi-worker.http). This file is self-contained; do not run the single-worker file first.

Both worker processes start with Aspire, but neither is assigned or linked automatically. Confirm the dashboard shows `worker-proxy` / `isolated-worker` and `worker-proxy-2` / `isolated-worker-2`, then follow the numbered requests:

1. Assign and link worker1, and confirm `/api/hello` returns `200`.
2. Assign and link worker2 to the same running Host, without restarting it.
3. Repeat worker2's link to check idempotency, then invoke repeatedly and compare the `X-Compute-Worker-Id` response headers. Once both workers are ready, requests alternate between their identities when no other traffic is running; worker2's ID has the `-2` suffix.

The fake platform accepts `?worker=first` or `?worker=second` on its worker assign/link routes; omitting the selector uses worker1. A `400` for `worker=second` with worker-selection guidance usually means the single-worker profile is running. Switch profiles and restart AppHost rather than retrying that request.

This project-mode scenario exercises **late linking**, not on-demand worker-process startup. The public invocation API does not support selecting a specific worker.

## Placeholder mode

`project-placeholder-manual` runs the Host the way it starts before it is assigned to an app: in placeholder mode (`WEBSITE_PLACEHOLDER_MODE=1`), with placeholder content, until it is assigned. It exercises how the Host behaves when specialization and the worker link overlap.

AppHost generates a random key for each run and gives it to both the Host and the fake platform. The fake platform uses it to authenticate and encrypt its `POST /admin/instance/assign` request, as the Host expects. The Host answers `202`, leaves placeholder mode, and specializes on its next request. Specialization completes only after the first worker links, so if the Host holds the link until specialization completes, step 3 never returns and the Host's health check stops responding.

## Container behavior

The dashboard has two independent resources, each backed by its own Compose project:

| Resource | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime` | The Host container and the shared Docker network. |
| `worker-pod-1` | WorkerProxy and the sample worker, sharing a network namespace. |

Stopping `worker-pod-1` removes only that pod's containers, leaving the same Host and network running. Stopping `runtime` stops the Host but keeps the network until AppHost shutdown. A small adapter runs these Compose groups because Aspire's native containers do not support the Proxy/worker shared-network arrangement.

`worker-pod.compose.yaml` is reusable for additional pods: each needs its own Compose project, Proxy alias, worker/request identities, and management port, while joining the runtime's network. These values are visible in the resource environments. Dynamic container add/remove controls are not implemented. The Host supports invocation setup for later-linked workers; the built-in two-worker Aspire scenario above is available only in project mode.

Stop AppHost to stop the local run; normal shutdown removes worker pods before the runtime and its network. If AppHost is forcibly terminated, remove its `functions-aspire-...` groups in Docker Desktop. Relinking restarted workers is not automated; start a new AppHost session for another end-to-end run.

This tool uses local-development transport and authentication settings. Do not expose its endpoints outside your development machine.
