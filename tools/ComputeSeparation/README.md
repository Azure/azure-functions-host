# Compute separation with Aspire

A local development tool for running the real Functions Host, WorkerProxy, and .NET isolated `SampleIsolatedApp` together.

The tool supplies no `host.json`. It sets the Host's existing read-only app-content option, so the unchanged Host uses defaults without writing that file.

## Prerequisites

- The repository's .NET SDK.
- For container deployment only, a running Linux x64 Docker engine with Docker Compose.

The first build downloads the matching Aspire toolchain into the worktree's build output. A global Aspire installation and Azure Functions Core Tools are not required.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

## Run with F5

Open `Azure.Functions.Host.slnx`, set `ComputeSeparation.AppHost` as the startup project, select a launch profile, and press **F5**:

| Profile | Runs locally |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | The Host, WorkerProxy, sample worker, and a fake platform as .NET projects for managed C# debugging. No Docker required. |
| `project-placeholder-manual` | Same as `project`, but the Host starts in placeholder mode, nothing is assigned or linked automatically, and ports are pinned for `compute-separation.http`. See [Placeholder mode](#placeholder-mode). |
| `container` | Three Linux containers: a ReadyToRun Host, Native AOT WorkerProxy, and ReadyToRun sample worker. |

`project` and `container` assign the worker pod to the `http` function group and then link the worker automatically. In `project`, AppHost makes both calls through the fake platform; in `container`, it calls the WorkerProxy and the Host directly. Every profile starts an Aspire dashboard. Container images are built from the current worktree; the first build can take several minutes. Nothing is published or deployed remotely.

The equivalent command-line launches are:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project-placeholder-manual
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile container
```

Run one profile at a time. No mode requires `aspire deploy` or `aspire publish`.

## Try the sample

Open the dashboard URL printed at startup. Find `functions-host` in project mode or `runtime` in container mode, open its `http` endpoint, and append `/api/hello`.

Once the Host has started, GET or POST requests return:

```text
Hello from the BYOC .NET isolated worker.
```

## Fake platform

In project mode, the `fake-platform` resource is a local stand-in for the platform. It sends the assign and link requests to the WorkerProxy and Host. It also stands in for AppServer: the Host's `FUNCTIONS_APPSERVER_URI` points at it, so it receives the Host's linked worker state.

Open the `fake-platform` console logs in the dashboard to watch the assign and link calls and the Host state pushes in order. The fake is not wired in container mode.

## Endpoints

### Expected flow

The happy path, in order:

| Step | Endpoint on | Caller | Request | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | WorkerProxy | Platform | `PUT /admin/worker/assignment` | Assigns the pod once its worker has connected. |
| 2 | Host | Platform | `POST /admin/instance/assign` | Assigns the placeholder Host to the app, which then specializes. Not sent in `project`, whose Host starts already specialized. |
| 3 | Host | Platform | `PUT /admin/workers/{workerId}` | Links the worker through the WorkerProxy runtime gRPC endpoint. |
| 4 | Host | Client | `GET /api/hello` | Invokes the function through Host -> WorkerProxy -> worker. |

The Host also publishes its linked worker counts with `PUT /admin/infra/host/state` on AppServer (the fake platform here): `(0, 0)` once the Host is specialized (right at startup in `project`), then `(1, 1)` once step 3 links the HTTP worker and the ScriptHost is running.

`GET /admin/worker/state` on the WorkerProxy reports the pod state at any time. The `project` profile sends steps 1 and 3 through the fake platform automatically; `project-placeholder-manual` leaves steps 1 to 3 to you.

### Test-only

Simulation routes live under `/simulate`, so they are never confused with the real contracts above.

| Endpoint on | Request | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/worker/assign` | Sends step 1 to the WorkerProxy and returns its response. |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/host/assign` | Sends step 2 to the Host and returns its response; see [Placeholder mode](#placeholder-mode). |
| Fake platform | `POST /simulate/worker/link` | Sends step 3 to the Host and returns its response. |
| Fake platform | `GET /simulate/host/state` | Returns the last Host state it accepted, or `204` if none yet. |

## Send requests manually

`compute-separation.http` walks through the expected flow one step at a time by calling the fake platform, which sends the assign and link calls. Run the `project-placeholder-manual` profile, then open the file in Visual Studio or VS Code with the REST Client extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In `project-placeholder-manual`, nothing is assigned or linked until you send the requests. Wait until every resource is **Running** in the dashboard, then send the numbered requests (1 to 4) in the order they appear in the file. If assign returns `503`, the sample worker has not connected yet; retry it before moving on. The requests marked *Optional* can be sent at any time.

## Placeholder mode

`project-placeholder-manual` runs the Host the way it starts before it is assigned to an app: in placeholder mode (`WEBSITE_PLACEHOLDER_MODE=1`), with placeholder content, until it is assigned. It exercises how the Host behaves when specialization and the worker link overlap.

AppHost generates a random key for each run and gives it to both the Host and the fake platform. The fake platform uses it to authenticate and encrypt its `POST /admin/instance/assign` request, as the Host expects. The Host answers `202`, leaves placeholder mode, and specializes on its next request. Specialization completes only after the first worker links, so if the Host holds the link until specialization completes, step 3 never returns and the Host's health check stops responding.

## Container behavior

The dashboard has two independent resources, each backed by its own Compose project:

| Resource | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime` | The Host container and the shared Docker network. |
| `worker-pod-1` | WorkerProxy and the sample worker, sharing a network namespace. |

Stopping `worker-pod-1` removes only that pod's containers, leaving the same Host and network running. Stopping `runtime` stops the Host but keeps the network until AppHost shutdown. A small adapter runs these Compose groups because Aspire's native containers do not support the Proxy/worker shared-network arrangement.

`worker-pod.compose.yaml` is reusable for additional pods: each needs its own Compose project, Proxy alias, worker/request identities, and management port, while joining the runtime's network. These values are visible in the resource environments. Dynamic add/remove controls and invocation readiness for later-linked workers are not implemented yet.

Stop AppHost to stop the local run; normal shutdown removes worker pods before the runtime and its network. If AppHost is forcibly terminated, remove its `functions-aspire-...` groups in Docker Desktop. Relinking restarted workers is not automated; start a new AppHost session for another end-to-end run.

This tool uses local-development transport and authentication settings. Do not expose its endpoints outside your development machine.
