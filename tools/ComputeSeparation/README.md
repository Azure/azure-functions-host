# Compute separation with Aspire

A local development tool for running the real Functions Host, WorkerProxy, and .NET isolated `SampleIsolatedApp` together.

The tool supplies no `host.json`. It sets the Host's existing read-only app-content option, so the unchanged Host uses defaults without writing that file.

## Prerequisites

- The repository's .NET SDK.
- For container deployment only, a running Linux x64 Docker engine with Docker Compose.

The first build downloads the matching Aspire toolchain into the worktree's build output. A global Aspire installation and Azure Functions Core Tools are not required.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

## Run with F5

Open `Azure.Functions.Host.slnx`, set `ComputeSeparation.AppHost` as the startup project, select a launch profile, and press **F5**:

| Profile | Runs locally |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | The Host, WorkerProxy, and sample worker as .NET projects for managed C# debugging. No Docker required. |
| `container` | Three Linux containers: a ReadyToRun Host, Native AOT WorkerProxy, and ReadyToRun sample worker. |

Both profiles start an Aspire dashboard and link the worker automatically. Container images are built from the current worktree; the first build can take several minutes. Nothing is published or deployed remotely.

The equivalent command-line launches are:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile project
dotnet run --project tools\ComputeSeparation\AppHost\ComputeSeparation.AppHost.csproj --launch-profile container
```

Run one profile at a time. Neither mode requires `aspire deploy` or `aspire publish`.

## Try the sample

Open the dashboard URL printed at startup. Find `functions-host` in project mode or `runtime` in container mode, open its `http` endpoint, and append `/api/hello`.

Once the Host has started, GET or POST requests return:

```text
Hello from the BYOC .NET isolated worker.
```

## Container behavior

The dashboard has two independent resources, each backed by its own Compose project:

| Resource | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime` | The Host container and the shared Docker network. |
| `worker-pod-1` | WorkerProxy and the sample worker, sharing a network namespace. |

Stopping `worker-pod-1` removes only that pod's containers, leaving the same Host and network running. Stopping `runtime` stops the Host but keeps the network until AppHost shutdown. A small adapter runs these Compose groups because Aspire's native containers do not support the Proxy/worker shared-network arrangement.

`worker-pod.compose.yaml` is reusable for additional pods: each needs its own Compose project, Proxy alias, worker/request identities, and management port, while joining the runtime's network. These values are visible in the resource environments. Dynamic add/remove controls and invocation readiness for later-linked workers are not implemented yet.

Stop AppHost to stop the local run; normal shutdown removes worker pods before the runtime and its network. If AppHost is forcibly terminated, remove its `functions-aspire-...` groups in Docker Desktop. Relinking restarted workers is not automated; start a new AppHost session for another end-to-end run.

This tool uses local-development transport and authentication settings. Do not expose its endpoints outside your development machine.
