# Azure Functions JSON Schemas

## IMPORTANT:
The schemas contained here are a copy of the schemas we publish to [**JSON Schema Store**](http://schemastore.org/json/), which is what the Azure Functions tooling (e.g. Visual Studio) uses.

Before making changes to any schema, please ensure you have the latest changes from the [Schema Store Repository](https://github.com/schemastore/schemastore/)

**IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO SCHEMAS** you must open a PR against the Schema Store repository with those changes.
