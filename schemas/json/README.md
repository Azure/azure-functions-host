# Azure Functions JSON Schemas

## IMPORTANT:
The schemas contained here are a copy of the schemas we publish to [**JSON Schema Store**](http://schemastore.org/json/), which is what the Azure Functions tooling (e.g. Visual Studio) uses.

Before making changes to any schema, please ensure you have the latest changes from the [Schema Store Repository](https://github.com/schemastore/schemastore/).

**Note:** The host.json schema is now maintained in the [Azure/Azure-Functions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions) repo.

**IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO SCHEMAS** you must open a PR against the Schema Store repository with those changes.
